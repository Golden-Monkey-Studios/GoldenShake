GoldenShake adds additional functionality to Sleitnick's Shake module

SETUP:
• (REQUIRED) Import the Shake module into your game.
    ◦ Wally: Add `Knit = "sleitnick/knit@1.4.7"` to your [Dependencies] and run
    `wally install`
• Place GoldenShake (this file's parent) inside of your preferred area to
run ModuleScripts. (I'd recommend making a folder in ReplicatedStorage called
"Common" or "Shared", and putting GoldenShake in there.)
• Look in the Config file (inside of GoldenShake) and change values according
to your use case
